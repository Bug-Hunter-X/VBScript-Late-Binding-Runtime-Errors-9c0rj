Early Binding and Error Handling:
The solution is to use early binding whenever possible (declaring object types explicitly) and to incorporate comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage runtime exceptions.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next

Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object.That.Might.NotExist")

If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error creating object: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
  Err.Clear
  ' Handle the error appropriately; perhaps use a default object or exit gracefully
Else
  ' Use the object
End If
```
This code explicitly uses On Error Resume Next, checks for errors using Err.Number, provides a user-friendly error message, and clears the error object.  Always prioritize early binding whenever possible for better performance and error prevention.
